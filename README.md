# DSBA-6010-U90 Model Risk Management

This course provides students a survey of major risk elements in quantitative predictive modeling. Basic steps and considerations in developing models are discussed, including topics such as performance measures, variable screening, transformation, and selection. The focus of the course is however placed on finding ways to improve models to better control risks. Topics discussed include causality, over-fitting/under-fitting, local and global interpretability and explainability, permutation, global sensitivity, global importance, partial dependence, LIME and SHAP, integrated gradient method, robustness, boundary perturbation, reliability, variability, conformability, resilience, natural language processing, fairness, etc.
